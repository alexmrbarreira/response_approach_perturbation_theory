# Response approach to perturbation theory

Code to compute the covariance matrix of matter power spectrum data using the response approach to perturbation theory.

The response approach was developed in these two papers:

- Barreira & Schmidt 2017a, https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09212
- Barreira & Schmidt 2017b, https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01092

where it was used to calculate covariance matrices as a first application.
