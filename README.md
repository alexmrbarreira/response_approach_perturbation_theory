# Covariances with the Response Approach

This code computes the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum using the response approach to perturbation theory. It was used in the numerical analysis of the papers:

- Barreira & Schmidt 2017a, https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09212
- Barreira & Schmidt 2017b, https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01092

who developed the response approach and used it, as a first application, to address the problem of accurate analytical calculations of covariance matrices. This code includes the Gaussian (G) term and the connected non-Gaussian (cNG) term up to 1-loop. For the remaining super-sample covariance term see the code (lensing SSC)[https://github.com/alexmrbarreira/gravitational_lensing_SSC].
