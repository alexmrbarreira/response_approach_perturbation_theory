# Covariances with the Response Approach

This code computes the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum using the response approach to perturbation theory. It includes the Gaussian (G) term and the connected non-Gaussian (cNG) term up to 1-loop. It does not include the super-sample covariance (SSC) term.

The response approach was developed in:

- Barreira & Schmidt 2017a, https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09212
- Barreira & Schmidt 2017b, https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01092

where it was used to calculate covariance matrices; these are the analysis and ploting scripts for these two papers. For more applications of the response approach see:
